<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>Software management for distributed teams has unique challenges.  Distributed teams are geographically separated.  There may also be cultural or language barriers. Communication requires additional effort.</p>

<h2><a name="theories">Theories</a></h2>
<h3>Social Identity Theory</h3>
<p>People are allocated to more one culture at a time, but different cultures are seen as being mutually exclusive. The theory predicts inter-group behavior on the basis of perceived group state differences, the perceived legitimacy and stability of those differences, and the perceived ability to move from one group to another.</p>

<h3>Technocracy</h3>
<p>The term was originally used to promote applying the scientific method to solving social problems, but is also an organizational structure of governance where decision-makers are selected on the basis of technological knowledge and merit. Technocrats are individuals with technical training and occupations who perceive many important social problems as being solvable, often while proposing technology-focused solutions. A technocrat is primarily driven by their cognitive “problem-solution mindset.”</p>

<h3>Swift Trust Theory</h3>
<p>Swift trust is a form of trust occurring in temporary organizational structures, which can include quick starting groups or teams. It was first explored by Debra Meyerson and colleagues in 1996. In swift trust theory, a group or team assumes trust initially, and later verifies and adjusts trust beliefs accordingly.
Traditionally, trust has been examined in the context of long-term relationships. The establishment of trust has been thought to rely largely on the history of a group and the interactions between members. This traditional view of trust generally assumes that trust builds over time. However, this view is becoming problematic with the increase in globalization, change in technologies, and an increased reliance on temporary teams by organizations. Meyerson et al. propose that swift trust provides the necessary, initial, cognitive confidence for a temporary team to interact as if trust were present. However, swift trust requires an individual to verify that a team can manage vulnerabilities and expectations.</p>

<h3>Media Richness Theory (MRT)</h3>
<p>This theory is based on the work of Daft and Lengel (1984 and 1986) and Daft, Lengel and Trevino (1987). MRT is a theory that can be used to describe the ability of communication media to transfer information. It assumes that organisations process information to reduce uncertainty and equivocality (Weiman,P 2010).</p>

<h2><a name="principles">Principles</a></h2>
<h3>Building trust</h3>
<p>Nothing is more important than this crucial element of a hyper-productive team, and building trust is essential in the formation of cohesiveness between team members. Gaining trust is a challenge when team members are distributed across different time zones, cultures, and environments, and when they also face communication, language, technical alignment, and project management issues. When a team doesn’t possess a minimum level of trust, it’s more difficult to deal with challenges when they appear – it is often easy to blame and criticize the ‘other’ groups and the team can break down into competing tribes. When trust is strong, team members are able to work through the most difficult issues and they often create innovative solutions.</p>

<h3>Time zone, language, and cultural barriers</h3>
<p>It is vital to create overlapping office hours so that remote teams can communicate, resolve problems, and bridge time zones for other mission-critical tasks. More overlapping time during the day fosters better engagement and collaboration. When team members come from different cultural backgrounds, language and cultural differences can easily create misunderstanding and generate mistrust among team members. In addition, team members in different regions generally have varying degrees of skill and technology expertise, which can create a class system between the different remote teams and hinder collaboration. W H I T E PA P E R : Successful Distributed Agile Team Working Patterns</p>

<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>As outlined in the section above, different time zones create communication challenges for teams. Overlapping office hours facilitate periods for discussions, problem solving, remote pairing, and other activities that contribute to a project’s success. It is crucial to create as much overlapping time during the day as possible. Team members at different locations often fall back to using low bandwidth communication channels, such as emails or documents, which generates large amounts of lost or misunderstood information. Therefore, high bandwidth communication tools such as video conferencing or desktop sharing should be used as frequently as possible.</p>

<h3>Technical alignments</h3>
<p>Team members from different backgrounds and regions may have divergent preferences about technologies and tools. For example, team members in Redmond, Washington may have a bias towards Microsoft technologies, while members in China may prefer open-source technologies. Misalignment in engineering best practices can also create conflicts between the remote teams – for example, determining whether to use test first vs. test later development practices or when to do refactoring. Other typical misalignments are coding standards, tooling, and architectural design. Within a co-located team, these misalignments on values are generally resolved over time by day-to-day discussion and communication between team members, with team members gradually building mutual understanding.</p>

<h3>Project and process management</h3>
<p>In a co-located team, the need for online project and process management is minimal— most co-located teams prefer a physical task board, and BVCs (big visible charts) in the team area to help them stay current on progress and information-sharing with other members. In a distributed environment, transparency and visibility are essential for all remote teams. High-visibility, real-time online project tracking and process management (for example, next Sprint planning dates, CI monitoring) enables all teams to be fully engaged in the development process.</p>

<h2><a name="practices">Practices</a></h2>

<h3>Build “The A Team“</h3>

<p>In order to have the highest quality possible and better productivity, synergy within the team is very important. Often, there are various challenges but this is the most important factor. Team members on the same frequency usually leads to successful projects.</p>

<h3>Set Expectations/Roles within the team</h3>
<p>Team members should always work towards same goal. In our case, it is delivering the highest quality product. Team managers/leads should let each and every team member know what role they are going to play in the project and their responsibility.</p>

<h3>Be Transparent within the team</h3>
<p>Being transparent keeps all the team members on same page, which helps reach their goals collectively.</p>

<h3>Communicate often within the team</h3>
<p>Since the team is distributed, communication is a very important factor, such as having daily calls with leads and with team if required. It is always necessary within the team to have a willingness to learn, share and communicate with peers.</p>

<h3>Status Reporting to the team</h3>
<p>Each and every team should share their status reports to let distributed team members know the progress, which will help them to carry out the tasks remaining.</p>

<h3>Setting up Video conferences</h3>
<p>If not daily or weekly, there should be monthly video conferences to help team to know whom they are working with especially if the team is distributed.</p>

<h3> Having face to face meeting (if possible)</h3>

<h3> Usage of Tools</h3>
<p>Tools help the distributed team to often store data, collaborate adequately within the team. SharePoint, blog, WebEx, net meeting, Team Viewer, Req Pro, Quality Center, Perforce, MS project are some of the examples. It also increases the productivity and helps us to stay on top of things.</p>
