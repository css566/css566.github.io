<p>The entire set of theories covered in this course is presented on the following map. The map follows the concept of a Stacey Matrix [1]. The x-axis represents the level of certainty while the y-axis represents the level of agreement. As items are close to Certainty, this means that cause and effect can be analyzed, while in the opposite way, this shows that those items are either unique or new which cause and effect can’t be analyzed yet. Bias level is evaluated through the agreement axis.</p>

<p>[1] These maps incoroporate the concept of the <a href="http://www.gp-training.net/training/communication_skills/consultation/equipoise/complexity/stacey.htm">Stacey matrix</a>
This is a useful map for navigating into complexity of concepts. It can help offering method to select the appropriate management actions in a complex adaptive system based on the degree of certainty and level of agreement on the issue in question.
Ralph Stacey proposes a matrix to help with this art by identifying management decisions on two dimensions: the degree of certainty and the level of agreement.</p>

<p>Close to Certainty: Issues or decisions are close to certainty when cause and effect linkages can be determined. This is usually the case when a very similar issue or decision has been made in the past. One can then extrapolate from past experience to predict the outcome of an action with a good degree of certainty.</p>

<p>Far from Certainty:	At the other end of the certainty continuum are decisions that are far from certainty. These situations are often unique or at least new to the decision makers. The cause and effect linkages are not clear. Extrapolating from past experience is not a good method to predict outcomes in the far from certainty range.</p>

<p>Agreement:	The vertical axis measures the level of agreement about an issue or decision within the group, team or organization. As you would expect, the management or leadership function varies depending on the level of agreement surrounding an issue.</p>
