<p>In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Large-Scale-Scrum-More-Craig-Larman/dp/0321985710">Large-Scale Scrum</a>, Craig Larman and Bas Vodde offer the most direct, concise, actionable guide to reaping the full benefits of agile in distributed, global enterprises. Larman and Vodde have distilled their immense experience helping geographically distributed development organizations move to agile. Going beyond their previous books, they offer today’s fastest, most focused guidance: “brass tacks” advice and field-proven best practices for achieving value fast, and achieving even more value as you move forward.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practices-Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development/dp/0321636406">Lean and Agile Development for Large-Scale Products: Key Practices for Sustainable Competitive Success</a>
Increasingly, large product-development organizations are turning to lean thinking, agile principles and practices, and large-scale Scrum to sustainably and quickly deliver value and innovation. Drawing on their long experience leading and guiding lean and agile adoptions for large, multisite, and offshore product development, internationally recognized consultant and best-selling author Craig Larman and former leader of the agile transformation at Nokia Networks Bas Vodde share the key action tools needed for success.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Approach-Large-Scale-Agile-Development/dp/0321821726/ref=pd_sim_14_21?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=51Eb%2bdU3WRL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR112,160_&amp;refRID=183F8EE9H3S0M7HTK1NV">A Practical Approach to Large-Scale Agile Development: How HP Transformed LaserJet FutureSmart Firmware (Agile Software Development Series)</a>
Today, even the largest development organizations are turning to agile methodologies, seeking major productivity and quality improvements. However, large-scale agile development is difficult, and publicly available case studies have been scarce. Now, three agile pioneers at Hewlett-Packard present a candid, start-to-finish insider’s look at how they’ve succeeded with agile in one of the company’s most mission-critical software environments: firmware for HP LaserJet printers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Software-Agility-Practices-Enterprises/dp/0321458192/ref=pd_sim_14_10?ie=UTF8&amp;dpID=41xvJ-zCakL&amp;dpSrc=sims&amp;preST=_AC_UL160_SR120,160_&amp;refRID=183F8EE9H3S0M7HTK1NV">Scaling Software Agility: Best Practices for Large Enterprises</a>
This book is invaluable to software developers, testers and QA personnel, managers and team leads, as well as to executives of software organizations whose objective is to increase the quality and productivity of the software development process but who are faced with all the challenges of developing software on an enterprise scale.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scaling-Lean-Agile-Development-Organizational/dp/0321480961">Lean Development and Agile Methods for Large-Scale Products: Key Thinking and Organizational Tools for Sustainable Competitive Success</a>
Increasingly, large product-development organizations are turning to lean thinking, agile principles and practices, and large-scale Scrum to sustainably and quickly deliver value and innovation. However, many groups have floundered in their practice-oriented adoptions. Why? Because without a deeper understanding of the thinking tools and profound organizational redesign needed, it is as though casting seeds on to an infertile field. Now, drawing on their long experience leading and guiding large-scale lean and agile adoptions for large, multisite, and offshore product development, and drawing on the best research for great team-based agile organizations, internationally recognized consultant and best-selling author Craig Larman and former leader of the agile transformation at Nokia Networks Bas Vodde share the key thinking and organizational tools needed to plant the seeds of product development success in a fertile lean and agile enterprise.</p>
