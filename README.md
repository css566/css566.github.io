# Usage instructions

## Creating a new Unit 
1. Create a new file under the [_posts](_posts) directory
2. The file name should be in the format `date-unit_name.md`, example `2016-04-18-syllabus.md`
3. The first line of the file needs to contain front matter, read about it [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/)
4. Frontmatter is the way to setup title and publish date and other attributes to the unit / article.
3. Its recommended to use markdown format when formatting units, Read more about markdown at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Example), Cheat Sheet for [quick reference](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
4. [Stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor) is a good editor for markdown. 
5. Markdown also supports in-line html in case you need to use it.


### Notes

1. The CI test system cannot validate links from LinkedIn.com because they're being a whining baby about their data and blocking requests from Travis CI. Refer [issue #215](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer/issues/215)
