	abstract = {In this paper we present {PasS} (privacy as a service); a set of security protocols for ensuring the privacy and legal compliance of customer data in cloud computing architectures. {PasS} allows for the secure storage and processing of users' confidential data by leveraging the tamper-proof capabilities of cryptographic coprocessors. Using tamper-proof facilities provides a secure execution domain in the computing cloud that is physically and logically protected from unauthorized access. {PasS} central design goal is to maximize users' control in managing the various aspects related to the privacy of sensitive data. This is achieved by implementing user-configurable software protection and data privacy mechanisms. Moreover, {PasS} provides a privacy feedback process which informs users of the different privacy operations applied on their data and makes them aware of any potential risks that may jeopardize the confidentiality of their sensitive information. To the best of our knowledge, {PasS} is the first practical cloud computing privacy solution that utilizes previous research on cryptographic coprocessors to solve the problem of securely processing sensitive data in cloud computing infrastructures.},

	abstract = {We introduce a formal model, which we call the Bounded Retrieval Model, for the design and analysis of cryptographic protocols remaining secure against intruders that can retrieve a limited amount of parties’ private memory. The underlying model assumption on the intruders’ behavior is supported by real-life physical and logical considerations, such as the inherent superiority of a party’s local data bus over a remote intruder’s bandwidth-limited channel, or the detectability of voluminous resource access by any local intruder. More specifically, we assume a fixed upper bound on the amount of a party’s storage retrieved by the adversary. Our model could be considered a non-trivial variation of the well-studied Bounded Storage Model, which postulates a bound on the amount of storage available to an adversary attacking a given system. In this model we study perhaps the simplest among cryptographic tasks: user authentication via a password protocol. Specifically, we study the problem of constructing efficient password protocols that remain secure against offline dictionary attacks even when a large (but bounded) part of the storage of the server responsible for password verification is retrieved by an intruder through a remote or local connection. We show password protocols having satisfactory performance on both efficiency (in terms of the server’s running time) and provable security (making the offline dictionary attack not significantly stronger than the online attack). We also study the tradeoffs between efficiency, quantitative and qualitative security in these protocols. All our schemes achieve perfect security (security against computationally-unbounded adversaries). Our main schemes achieve the interesting efficiency property of the server’s lookup complexity being much smaller than the adversary’s retrieval bound.},

	abstract = {Textual passwords are often the only mechanism used to authenticate users of a networked system. Unfortunately, many passwords are easily guessed or cracked. In an attempt to strengthen passwords, some systems instruct users to create mnemonic phrase-based passwords. A mnemonic password is one where a user chooses a memorable phrase and uses a character (often the first letter) to represent each word in the phrase.In this paper, we hypothesize that users will select mnemonic phrases that are commonly available on the Internet, and that it is possible to build a dictionary to crack mnemonic phrase-based passwords. We conduct a survey to gather user-generated passwords. We show the majority of survey respondents based their mnemonic passwords on phrases that can be found on the Internet, and we generate a mnemonic password dictionary as a proof of concept. Our 400,000-entry dictionary cracked 4\% of mnemonic passwords; in comparison, a standard dictionary with 1.2 million entries cracked 11\% of control passwords. The user-generated mnemonic passwords were also slightly more resistant to brute force attacks than control passwords. These results suggest that mnemonic passwords may be appropriate for some uses today. However, mnemonic passwords could become more vulnerable in the future and should not be treated as a panacea.},

	abstract = {Users frequently reuse their passwords when authenticating to various online services. Combined with the use of weak passwords or honeypot/phishing attacks, this brings high risks to the security of the user’s account information. In this paper, we propose several protocols that can allow a user to use a single password to authenticate to multiple services securely. All our constructions provably protect the user from dictionary attacks on the password, and cross-site impersonation or honeypot attacks by the online service providers.

Our solutions assume the user has access to either an untrusted online cloud storage service (as per Boyen [16]), or a mobile storage device that is trusted until stolen. In the cloud storage scenario, we consider schemes that optimize for either storage server or online service performance, as well as anonymity and unlinkability of the user’s actions. In the mobile storage scenario, we minimize the assumptions we make about the capabilities of the mobile device: we do not assume synchronization, tamper resistance, special or expensive hardware, or extensive cryptographic capabilities. Most importantly, the user’s password remains secure even after the mobile device is stolen. Our protocols provide another layer of security against malware and phishing. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose such various and provably secure password-based authentication schemes. Lastly, we argue that our constructions are relatively easy to deploy, especially if a few single sign-on services (e.g., Microsoft, Google, and Facebook) adopt our proposal.},
