    <ul>
  <li>Build continual planning and customer feedback into the process
    <ul>
      <li>Value is maximized throughout the development process [1]</li>
      <li>“As a result of this iterative planning and feedback loop, teams are able to continuously align the delivered software with desired business needs, easily adapting to changing requirements throughout the process.” [1]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Early and frequent delivery of value to customers
    <ul>
      <li>Agile development “accelerates the delivery of initial business value” [1]
        <ul>
          <li>This can be empirically measured, such as the in-class penny exercise that proved that iterative small batches results in faster delivery of value to the customer</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Customers will reduce the value they place on something if they have to wait too long, so early delivery is better [4]</li>
      <li>Early delivery means early money to use for other business needs and investments [3]</li>
      <li>Continual cash flow is healthier for the business than waiting for money at the end of a project [3]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Iterative development
    <ul>
      <li>Ideas, concepts, and software features depreciate over time and have a “freshness window” before people place no value in them, so Agile development works within that 1-4 week timeframe to stay on top of customer needs and market demands [4</li>
      <li>Iterative software product produces less value more frequently and is able to achieve higher overall value before depreciating revenue-wise [4]</li>
      <li>Risk is “reset” every iteration due to iterative reevaluation of product [4]</li>
      <li>Bug cost is reduced because they are continually tested and squashed instead of looked at far after the code is written [4]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Theory of constraints - “The chain is no stronger than its weakest link” [5]
    <ul>
      <li>Limiting amount of work that causes constraint or bottleneck</li>
      <li>Diverting work away from the bottleneck</li>
      <li>Increasing limitation of bottleneck by buying systems or hiring people</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use of agile methodology to reduce cost of failure [5]
    <ul>
      <li>Faster feedback from stakeholders</li>
      <li>Increasing flow of information within participating entities in a scrum</li>
      <li>Decreasing the risk of one person failing by reducing number of dependencies on that person and distributing work equally amongst everyone</li>
      <li>Focusing more on simplicity and reducing complication</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Importance of refactoring in agile [6]
    <ul>
      <li>More cost is incurred for adding features than the business benefits of adding these features if software system becomes dysfunctional and complicated</li>
      <li>Refactoring is safest and cheapest when done in many small chunks</li>
      <li>Use of business requests as catalysts for refactoring rather than call from technical teams</li>
      <li>Team cohesion in terms of communication and collaboration in regards to which tools, techniques, and practices to use in refactoring</li>
      <li>Team’s openness and honesty with all stakeholders about the cost of refactoring</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Shorter feedback loops [7]
    <ul>
      <li>In agile, risks are cut down because of short releases in contrary to multi-year waterfall projects. Hence, feedback reduced to a smaller period</li>
      <li>Comparison of the opportunity cost of agile and waterfall results in identifying waste of money and missing opportunity of working on more profitable projects in waterfall</li>
      <li>
        <p>User satisfaction has value too and not just return on investment in the form of money</p>
      </li>
