* Economic exchanges are highly equal, visible, short-term and focused on the thing being exchanged. This is characteristic of employee-employer relationships.
* Social exchanges are less concerned with the urgency and equality of transactions, and are more concerned with longevity, empathy, and belonging in the relationship. Organizations try to create this in their culture, because it can cause employees to give effort selflessly.
