### Quick Kanban Overview
-----
Kanban is another management style developed by the Toyota motor corporation in Japan in the 1940s. Kanban is centered around the constant flow of value to the customer and Kanban is centered around visual cues to help see the flow of progress of a project.

### Kanban Concepts
Much like Agile and Scrum, the physical aspects of Kanban revolve around implementing a physical environment that best facilitates implementation of Kanban theories and practices. To better understand Kanban theories and practices, the following primer on Kanban is provided.

### Kanban Theories
Kanban employs the Theory of Constraints, The System of Proud Knowledge, and the Lean economical model. The Theory of Constraints focuses on identifying bottlenecks in the flow of work, and catering all other tasks around that bottleneck. The System of Proud Knowledge helps to visually identify the bottlenecks in the flow of work and to make the bottlenecks (area’s of improvement) visually clear to everyone involved in the process. The Lean economical model focuses on eliminating “mura” or “waste” out of the flow of work. This helps to smooth out the working experience.  

### Kanban Teams
Unlike other software management styles and methods, Kanban doesn’t have a hard ceiling or floor on the number of people on a Kanban team. The team sizes in Kanban are decided on a project basis, company basis, product basis, and so on. The key point to Kanban teams is they have to fit into the flow of delivery value nicely. In other words, if a Kanban team is notices that they are constantly being bottlenecked or causing a bottleneck maybe it’s time to look into team size or team composition as one of the many potential factors disrupting the flow of work. 

## Kanban Artifacts
Much like other agile management styles, physical Kanban artifacts are used to represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Kanban are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody in the workflow has the same understandings.

### Product Backlog

Kanban also employs a physical Product Backlog. This product backlog signifies all the features of a product a customer wants. A product backlog is usually represented as one column in a Kanban Board.





### Kanban Board

On the Kanban board there exists Kanban cards. These Kanban cards are used to signify a chunk of work that denotes a feature of the desired product. Kanban cards are assigned to teams or individuals to complete. Kanban cards usually flow from one side of the Kanban board (starting from the product backlog column) to the other side of the Kanban board that usually represents finish and completed work. One special attribute of the Kanban board is the Work in Progress Limit columns of the board (WIP limits). What these special columns signify is the maximum amount of work that is allowed at any stage of the work flow. Having too many cards constantly pushing the WIP limit can easily tell a company where the bottlenecks are in the flow of delivering value.  


### Monitoring Progress Towards a Goal
At any point in time, a worker can glance at the physical Kanban board and see the flow of work. The shifting of kanban cards from one side of the board to the other easily demonstrates the amount of progress that has been made, and it’s also easy to identify the bottlenecks by looking at the WIP columns. 

## The Physical Kanban Environment

The physical space that works the best for facilitating Kanban management style is an open space that allows for easy visual glances at the Kanban board. Everyone should have an easy sightline to the Kanban board to see the progress of work, and the working environment should allow for collaboration as with other agile management styles and methodologies. The constant delivery of value is key in Kanban. Having a work space that promotes collaboration among individuals and teams allow for a smoother process of work and delivering value to the customer.
