## <a name="issues">ISSUES</a>



- Large changes to a stable system will destabilize and break it in large ways 



- People working together creates conflict 



- Unresolved conflict has a negative impact on team performance and creates a dysfunctional team atmosphere 


- Sometimes, the goal of a Scrum Meeting can become obsolete, in such a case if the Product Owner stills continues to go ahead with it, the session becomes less productive.


- If people working on the same components/modules are not in constant communication about the status of their work, there could be overlap of feature or other functional implementations.
