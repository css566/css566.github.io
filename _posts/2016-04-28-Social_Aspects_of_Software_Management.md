 Picture 1. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs [23]

Maslow’s hierarchy of needs is a model representing the stages of human development.Drawn as a pyramid, the most fundamental physiological needs lie at the bottom, and the psychological needs linear the top. For each need to be realized, all of the levels below it in the hierarchy need to be satisfied as well.An important theory related to the social aspect of LeSS is neatly embedded in this model.

If one were to look at a scrum team ­members’ satisfaction with their job and their contributions to their team, it would be fairly straightforward to argue that in order to extract meaning from their work, to achieve a sense of belonging, and to actualize the potential of their contributions, that they should require approval and association with their peers. Hence, the importance of a well socialized workplace is self evident.

   Picture 2.  Theory X, Y and Z compared together [22]
   
   
   Theories X, Y, and Z model human management and motivation. According to X and Y,two contrasting managerial styles are formed from the diametrically opposed assumptions of how workers are motivated. While X emphasizes strict supervision, external rewards, and negative reinforcement, Theory Y implies that job satisfaction is the motivation that encourages workers to take on tasks without supervision. Theory Z focuses on employee loyalty and a holistic life ­balanced approach to job satisfaction.

#### <a name="theory1">Theory Z</a>

William Ouchi’s theory taken from Japanese management style. William Ouchi theorized that the key to better performance is employee loyalty.[1] [10]

#### <a name="theory2">Make Everyone a winner: Theory W</a>

Software project managers can only be successful if they make all project participants a winner[2] [6]

#### <a name="theory3">Theory Y</a>

Trust your employees and they will perform better.  People perform best when they are allowed to be self-directed, and perform work they have committed to. [25]

#### <a name="theory4">Theory Pi</a>

In Theory Pi, Mallette asserts that engineers and scientists as a group tend to have characteristics that require a different management style than the average worker.[9]

#### <a name="theory5">Social Exchange Theory</a>

People develop relationships with others they exchange with. The way this exchange occurs and how frequently can affect relationship quality [24]

#### <a name="defining-roles-and-task">  Define roles and tasks of team members</a>

 For productivity, roles of team members should be defined clearly. These roles may be project manager, team lead, developer, tester etc. Furthermore, authorizations and responsibilities of these roles should be defined very clearly. Task-assignment based development should also be applied for avoiding redundant efforts and chaos.

#### <a name="define-meeting-types">Define meeting types</a>

Meetings are very important if we are talking about software process management and should be defined in detail (meeting participants, context, average duration etc.).[4]

#### <a name="save-lesson-learned-info">Save "lessons learned" info for your projects</a>

Even if there are experienced staff in projects, there may be unforeseen events which may obstruct or retard development process. This can be a complex item configuration, error, production experience etc. Those happenings are highly preferred to be written in "lessons learned" documents and shared in public locations. This will avoid recurrence of time loss and provide more productive software process management. [4]
